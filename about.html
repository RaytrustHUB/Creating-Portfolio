                        Hello, thank you for checking out my personal webpage! This is my very first complete website. I am building it using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML is used for layout, CSS is used mostly for styling purposes, and JavaScript is used for functionality within the website! I hope to become a very efficient full-stack developer. My ultimate goal is to grow my knowledge of technology and hopefully create something out of this world! I have always been very interested in anything technology-related and believe I have the potential to learn and create great things!
